# Fairdrive Design Documentation

This document provides a high-level overview of the design of the Fairdrive application. It's intended to help contributors understand the architecture of the application and the design decisions that were made during its development.

## Architecture

Fairdrive is a web application built using React and Next.js. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Next.js is a framework that provides features such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

The application is organized into several directories:

- `src/pages`: This directory contains the main pages of the application.
- `src/components`: This directory contains reusable React components.
- `src/context`: This directory contains React context providers for state management.
- `src/api`: This directory contains modules for interacting with the backend.

## Components

The application is built using a component-based architecture. Each component is a reusable piece of the user interface, and components can be composed together to build complex UIs.

Components are defined using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

## State Management

State management in Fairdrive is handled using the Context API, a feature of React that allows you to share state between components without passing props down the component tree.

There are several context providers defined in the `src/context` directory, each encapsulating a different part of the application state.

## APIs

The application interacts with the backend through several APIs, encapsulated in the `src/api` directory. These APIs use Axios, a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.

## Styling

Styling in Fairdrive is handled using CSS. Each component has its own CSS file, which is imported into the component's JavaScript file. This allows for component-specific styles that don't affect other parts of the application.

## Testing

Testing in Fairdrive is done using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, and React Testing Library, a library for testing React components. Tests are located in the `__tests__` directory.

## Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the design of the Fairdrive application. For more detailed information, please refer to the codebase and the other documentation files.
