## Account Migration
You have the option to transition your Metamask-created Lite account to an FDP Portable account.

Your Lite account will be connected with your new Portable account.
During this transition process, you'll be given a new mnemonic. It's crucial to note this down and keep it in a secure location, as it will serve as your mnemonic for your Portable account recovery.
