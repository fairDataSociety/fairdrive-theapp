# Fairdrive

At the intersection of innovation, interoperability, and decentralization, Fairdrive emerges for the cause of fair data. This initiative, driven by the community, is dedicated to promoting freedom. By facilitating decentralized storage, it allows developers to construct interoperable, decentralized, and open-source dApps. This, in turn, enables users to regain their privacy, assume ownership of their data, and control their digital identity.

### What is Fairdrive

Fairdrive is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates distributed storage on the Swarm network. It features a "Drive" interface for managing pods, files and folders. Internally, Fairdrive uses Fair Data Protocol, which is built on top of Ethereum Swarm. 

### Why Fairdrive
#### Pros
- **Data Encryption**: Fairdrive encrypts all data by default, providing an additional layer of security for your files.
- **Data Ownership**: Unlike traditional cloud storage services, where your data is technically owned by the service provider, with Fairdrive, you are the sole owner of your data.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Fairdrive stores data on the Swarm decentralized network. This means your data isn't stored in a single location, but is distributed across multiple nodes, enhancing data security and reliability.
- **User Control**: Only you have access to your data. You control who can access your data and how it's used.

#### Cons
- **Speed**: Due to its decentralized nature, Fairdrive can be slower than traditional cloud storage services. This is because data isn't stored in a single location, but is distributed across multiple nodes in the Swarm network. As a result, it can take longer to retrieve data.
- **Learning Curve**: As a decentralized application (dApp), Fairdrive might have a steeper learning curve for users who are not familiar with blockchain technology and decentralized networks.
- **Dependence on Swarm Network**: The performance and reliability of Fairdrive are dependent on the Swarm network. If there are issues with the network, it could affect the availability and performance of Fairdrive.
- **Data Recovery**: In case of loss of access keys, data recovery might be challenging or impossible due to the decentralized and encrypted nature of the storage.

## Join Us in Building Fairdrive
Fairdrive is a community-driven initiative, and we welcome contributions from anyone who shares our vision for a decentralized, user-controlled digital world. Whether you're a developer, a designer, a writer, or just someone who's interested in what we're doing, there are many ways you can contribute to Fairdrive.

If you're a developer, you can help us improve the Fairdrive application by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving our documentation. Check out our [open issues](https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairdrive-theapp/issues) to see what we're currently working on.

If you're a designer, we'd love your help in improving the user interface and user experience of Fairdrive. You can help us design new features, improve existing ones, or create assets like icons and illustrations.

If you're a writer, you can help us improve our user documentation, write blog posts about Fairdrive, or help us spread the word about Fairdrive on social media.

And even if you're not a developer, designer, or writer, you can still contribute by testing Fairdrive, reporting bugs, or suggesting new features.

We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute, and we're committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. So if you're interested in joining us, please check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

Together, we can make Fairdrive the best it can be!


## Development Stage Notice for Fairdrive
Please be aware that Fairdrive is currently in its development stage. This means that the application is still undergoing substantial updates, modifications, and improvements. As a result, certain functionalities may change, be added, or removed without prior notice.

During this development stage, there's also a risk of data loss. While we strive to ensure the integrity and security of all data stored on Fairdrive, the decentralized nature of the application and the ongoing development work mean that we cannot guarantee complete data preservation.

## Running in development mode

Furthermore, please note that the maintainers of Fairdrive do not assume responsibility for any data loss, changes in functionality, or any other issues that may arise while using the application during its development stage.

We strongly recommend that you keep backups of any critical data you store on Fairdrive and use the application with an understanding of these risks during its development stage. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve and refine Fairdrive.
